# Opps-only

Welcome to **Opps-only**, a repository dedicated to my journey in learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Java. This project serves both as a personal archive and as a resource for anyone interested in foundational OOP concepts, sample code, and practical usage.

## About

**Opps-only** contains code examples and exercises that illustrate key object-oriented concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Interfaces
- Common Design Patterns

Each example is written to be clear and beginner-friendly, making it a useful reference for students, educators, and developers seeking to reinforce their understanding of OOP.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Platform:** Any system with JDK installed

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to make navigation easy and logical. Typical folder and file layout may look like:

```
/Opps-only
  ├── src/
  │    ├── inheritance/
  │    ├── polymorphism/
  │    ├── encapsulation/
  │    └── ...other concepts
  ├── README.md
  └── ...other supporting files
```

Each folder contains Java files focused on a specific OOP concept, with clear naming conventions.
