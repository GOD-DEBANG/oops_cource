    //Wrapping up the implementation of the data member and data method in the class , that's mean encapsulation
// in simple term we can say encapsulation solves implementation level issue
    //encapsulation mean it is the code that solve the abstraction level or design level problem
    // example : if any one call static or println the code behind the println will be the encapsulation
    // this code is responsible for the implementation
    // it hides the code into single entity internally and protected from outer world
    // it focuses on the internal world
    // encapsulation is the process of containing information
    // Encapsulation focuses on hiding complexity of the system
    // data hiding focus on data security ex: getters and setters
    // data hiding should be private cannot be accessed
    //but in encapsulation data can be private public void anything
    // encapsulation is a part of data hiding
